This is my implementation of the seminal paper  "boids, flocks & ..." from Craig Reynolds, made for a CG assignement. The requirements were: a 3D world, four cameras (behind the flock, beside the flock, behind the leader boid and one fixated on the ground) and iillumination. In addition to that, i implemented some extra features:  fractal landscapes, fog, pause, animated boids, etc.

Here is a video of the program in execution. During the runtime, the user can tweak the various parameters until satisfied with the results.
