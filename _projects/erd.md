Estrada Real Digital is an educational game developed at DCC-UFMG (Computer Science Department - Federal University of Minas Gerais). It is a 3D third person adventure game ambiented on a Brazil's beaultiful natural and cultural patrimony. I worked as Lead Programmer on two versions of the game. The first one was very crappy. It was made using Crystal Space 3D Engine. I started to work after the development had already started and the project had been defined. So the best to do was to finish the development with what I had and wait for the chance to work on the second version of the game from the beginning of the project.

On the second version, I had the chance to define some key aspecs of the game, like:
The technology: We have to use only free software on the whole project, then I researched some game engines to help with the development and I found Panda3D very interesting. It fits all of my restrictions, has a good documentation and It is very easy to learn and use, so It was my choice.
Some aspects of Game Design and Gameplay: I pointed the development of a platform with run-time edit and tweak capabilities. This helped with the game design process and gave us the best short paper of SBGames 2008.
Here are some videos of the second version of the game running and you can download the installer here:
