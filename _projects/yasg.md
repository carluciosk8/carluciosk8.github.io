YASG: Yet Another Scorched Game. This is a very simple [artillery game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_game){:target="_blank"} that I developed for the first assignment of a unfinished PGCert course at [UP](https://www.up.edu.br){:target="_blank"} (former UnicenP). The goal of this assignment was to develop a simple, but complete game in one week, to make the participants to get an idea of the work necessary to finish a complete game.

As someone interested in [Procedural Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation){:target="_blank"}, I chose this game mainly because its main characteristic is that all graphic elements, like the terrain, players and background are procedurally generated in runtime. Here is a video of the game:
