When I attended Artificial Intelligence discipline, we should choose a problem and present a common and a parallel solution to this problem, implementing it in C using MPI for parallel programming. I chose the pathfinding problem and proposed to use the A* (A star) algorithm. My parallel solution was to perform a bidirectional search with another task performing the search in the opposite direction until the two searches meet at some point.
