This is a little game I made for a computer graphics assignment. The task was to create a clone of an old arcade game called Galaxian. The project had some requisites like emulating an analog controller with the mouse: The player must use the mouse to control a "velocity bar" located on the bottom of the screen to control the speed of the space ship to move it.
