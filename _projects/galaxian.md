This is a little game that I created for a Computer Graphics assignment for introducing programming with OpenGL. The task was to create a clone of an old arcade game called [Galaxian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxian){:target="_blank"}. The project had some requisites like emulating an analog controller with the mouse: The player must use the mouse to control a "velocity bar" located on the bottom of the screen to control the speed of the space ship to move it.
