My name is Carl√∫cio. I created this site as a portfolio of my work in Computer Science and various other related things of my interest like: games, softwares, computers, video game consoles, game development, software development, retrogames, retrocomputing and skateboard. Ok ok, for almost everyone of you, skateboard don't have nothing in common with computers. But for me, computers and skateboard have a lot in common because when I was a little kid in late 80's, I started to ride a skateboard and also learn how to program my MSX microcomputer and latter a Commodore Amiga 500. Since then, computers, games and skateboard has a very big influence on me.
