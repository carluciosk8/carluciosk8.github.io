My name is Carl√∫cio. I created this site as a portfolio of my work.

My first steps in programming started in 1987, when I got an MSX microcomputer and started to learn the BASIC programming language. In addition, my fascination with video games led me to learn programming, especially graphics applications and simple games. So, I started to realize that programming by itself is a very fun "game".

1998 to 2011 was my academic years. During this time, I accomplished my graduation and master degree in computer science. I also worked as a rescearcher and a professor by some years. In 2011 I started working in the software industry, and since then, I have had the opportunity to work with different areas, technologies and applications such as: embedded software, mining systems, geospatial systems, training software, virtual reality, simulations and autonomous vehicles. I am motivated by solving complex problems involving programming and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities. Currently I am pursuing an old dream of being an independent game developer.

In addition to computers and video games, skateboarding has also been part of my lifestyle since the 80s, being my greatest inspiration for evolution and perseverance.
