My first steps in computing started in 1987, when I got an MSX microcomputer. As a kid fascinated with video games I started to learn Basic programming language, especially graphics applications and simple games. Since then, I started to realize that programming by itself is a very fun "game".

From 1998 to 2011 I accomplished my graduation and master degree in computer science. I also worked as a rescearcher and a professor by some years. In 2011 I started working in the software industry, and since then, I have had the opportunity to work with different areas, technologies and applications such as: embedded software, mining systems, geospatial systems, training software, virtual reality, simulations and autonomous vehicles. After the Covid-19 pandemic and with the new reality of the home office, I was finally able to have my childhood dream job working with games!

In addition to computers and video games, skateboarding has also been part of my lifestyle since the 80s, being my greatest inspiration for evolution and perseverance.
