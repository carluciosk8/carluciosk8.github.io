As someone who loves procedural content generation, fractals are another subject that I have lots of interest. My first contact with fractals was done through Amiga demos like [Phenomena by Enigma](https://youtu.be/iGpU3DicbLQ?t=445) and softwares as Scene Generator and [Vista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistaPro). But before having an Amiga, I learned programming using MSX Basic and I loved to do very simple graphics stuff, many of them through listings present in magazines from that time.

Many years later, specifically in 2018, Clube MSX, a new MSX Magazine has emerged. This is a completely independent magazine created by Mario Cavalcanti. So, I decided to write an article about programming fractals on MSX BASIC to be listed in the magazine, just like the articles that I read when I was a kid. I contacted Mario to sort out the details and the article was published on [MSX Magazine NÂ° 9](https://www.clubemsx.com.br/produto/revista-clube-msx-9/){:target="_blank"}
