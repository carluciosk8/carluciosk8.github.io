After I left my academic carrer, I started to work as an embedded software engineer for mining equipment. My most significant work was on a high precision guidance system for determining the bucket position of excavators. This was a great challenge for me, since I had the opportunity to work in the core solution of the product. I researched and developed mathematical models for determining the bucket position of the excavator based on a high precision GPS and inclinometers. I also developed a simulator to do some software-in-the-loop testing of the mathematical models. At last, I had a chance to participate in the deployment of the system on a real Caterpillar 365C and a Bucyrus 495HD excavators.
